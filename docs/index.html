        <h2>Time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> was born in Smiljan, present-day Croatia, on July 10, <strong>1856.</strong> </li>
          <li>At the <strong>age of three</strong>, while petting his cat, <strong>Tesla</strong> was surprised by a shower of sparks and wanted to know what the reason was</li>
          <li>At just <strong>17 years old</strong>, young Nikola fell seriously ill with cholera and almost never recovered.</li>
          <li>After recovering and entering the army, in <strong>1875</strong>, Tesla began his studies at the Polytechnic University of Graz, in Austria.</li>
          <li>During his time as a student he began to develop the purpose that would accompany him forever: to devise the way in which free energy could reach the whole world.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1881</strong> he traveled to Vienna, where he worked at the <strong>National Telephone Company.</strong></li>
          <li>Tesla eventually moved to Paris, where he found work at the <strong>Edison Company.</strong></li>
          <li>From the French capital he traveled to New York in <strong>1884</strong> – the same year that the Statue of Liberty also arrived from Paris. Once in the city, Tesla went directly to the offices of the man who would definitely influence his life: <strong>Thomas Alva Edison</strong>. Edison hired him that same day. But their relationship was far from placid.</li>
          <li>Tesla and Edison had deep differences. Edison was in favor of direct current and Tesla, of alternating current. Edison did not want to put his fortune at risk because of a "newcomer. This dispute is known as <strong>"the war of the currents".</strong></li>
          <li>In <strong>1886</strong>, Tesla founded his own company, <strong>Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing </strong>. The first investors did not agree with his plans for the development of an alternating current motor and finally ended up relieving him of his position in the company. But Tesla did not give up and he worked as a laborer in New York from <strong>1886</strong> to <strong>1887</strong> in order to survive and earn money for his next project. </li>
          <li>In <strong>1887</strong>, he built an alternating current-powered, brushless induction motor, which he presented to the <strong>American Institute of Electrical Engineers</strong> in <strong>1888</strong>. That same yeardeveloped the principle of his coil, and began working with <strong>George Westinghouse</strong> at <strong>Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh Laboratories.</strong> Westinghouse listened carefully to his ideas on polyphase systems, which could allow the transmission of alternating current over long distances, and he bet on him.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1893</strong>, Tesla worked with Westinghouse to develop a project to supply electricity to the city of <strong>Buffalo</strong> by harnessing the power of the Niagara River Falls.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1895</strong>, a <strong>fire</strong> in <strong>Tesla's laboratory in New York</strong> caused incalculable losses to science, since in addition to the building <strong>all his projects were destroyed.</strong> But nothing could with Tesla. </li>
          <li>Tesla presented in <strong>1898</strong> an invention called <strong>"Teleautomaton"</strong>, a miniature boat <strong>controlled remotely</strong> by <strong>radio</strong>. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the <strong>US military</strong>, but at the time the navy showed little interest.Nor did he appear as the inventor of the device. This merit went to the Spanish engineer <strong>Leonardo Torres Quevedo</strong>, who patented the "Telekino" in <strong>1903</strong>, which was considered the first radio-controlled device in history.</li>
          <li>Tesla also had problems with <strong>Marconi</strong> , who is credited with the invention of the <strong>radio</strong>. Marconi won the <strong>Nobel Prize</strong> in <strong>1909</strong> for this invention, even though Tesla had patented the idea in <strong1896></strong>. But the patent office backed down and eventually gave Marconi the patent for the invention.</li>
          <li>Finally, in <strong>1943</strong> the <strong>Supreme Court of the United States</strong> recognized <strong></strong> shortly before his death as the inventor of the radio and returned the patent, which had been in Marconi's possession until then.</li>
          <li><strong>Nikola Tesla died</strong> alone on <strong>January 7, 1943</strong>, in a hotel room in New York, at the age of <strong>86</strong>, from a myocardial infarction. His funeral, which was held in the <strong>Cathedral of Saint John the Divine</strong>, was attended by more than <strong>2,000 people</strong> who mourned the loss of a <strong>true genius.</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>United States government</strong>, once Nikola Tesla was buried, <strong>seized his office and seized all the documents </strong>that contained his <strong>studies and research</strong>, however, <strong>some could not be understood or deciphered since Tesla kept most of his ideas in his mind.</strong> Years later, the family of Nikola Tesla, through the Yugoslav embassy, ​​managed to recover part of the seized material .</li>
          <li>Today, the <strong>life</strong> and <strong>work</strong> of <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> are revealed in the museum that bears his name in <strong>Belgrade</strong>. A curious and very interesting place to better understand the importance of one of the most important inventors in history.</li>
